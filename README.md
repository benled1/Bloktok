## WELCOME TO BLOKTOK </h3>
Do you ever find yourself sucked into a wormhole of TikTok brainrot? It's easy to get lost in hypnotizing videos of minecraft or subway surfers - complemented with an outlandish Reddit post read out to you by a robotic text-to-speech voice. 
- My STALKER-IN LAWS are FOLLOWING MY EVERY MOVE üîç
- I REFUSED to be ADOPTED ü§∞
- My Roommate OWED me Money and I had to use EXTREME MEASURES to get it from him üí∏
- I Gave my WIFE an ULTIMATUM üíç
  
You get the picture. Now imagine an application that could generate these videos from the single link to a Reddit post...
Well good news, we're ahead of the game. Welcome to BlokTok, where we bring your Reddit brainrot to life!

## Installation

Installation is quite hefty. We recommend Windows only since that's where it has been tested. On top of that, here are the following prerequisites.

1. Install vlc for your OS. https://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-windows.html
2. Install Image Magick. https://imagemagick.org/script/download.php
3. Pip install the Python requirements. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Create a `.env` file following the .env_template file in the `Frontend/backend/` dir. This file should contain your own API keys for open AI and Reddit bearer token.
  - grab these keys by following the videos: [Reddit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9boO9x3TDA) and [OpenAI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8-En6J9o-Y)

## Instructions
1. Begin by searching far and wide for your favourite Reddit story - the more clickbait, the better.
2. Copy the link to the post and paste it into BlokTok.
3. Sit back, relax, enjoy a 2 minute coffee break, go outside and touch some grass while you're at it, and before you know it your minecraft video is ready!
4. Distribute your video to your heart's content, rotting the brains of all iPad children across the world.
