## WELCOME TO BLOKTOK </h3>
Do you ever find yourself sucked into a wormhole of TikTok brainrot? It's easy to get lost in hypnotizing videos of minecraft or subway surfers - complemented with an outlandish Reddit post read out to you by a robotic text-to-speech voice. 
- My STALKER-IN LAWS are FOLLOWING MY EVERY MOVE 🔍
- I REFUSED to be ADOPTED 🤰
- My Roommate OWED me Money and I had to use EXTREME MEASURES to get it from him 💸
- I Gave my WIFE an ULTIMATUM 💍
  
You get the picture. Now imagine an application that could generate these videos from the single link to a Reddit post...
Well good news, we're ahead of the game. Welcome to BlokTok, where we bring your Reddit brainrot to life!
