his 

205 
00:01:5,740 --> 00:01:6,160 
funeral. 

206 
00:01:6,880 --> 00:01:7,360 
He 

207 
00:01:7,360 --> 00:01:7,780 
apparently 

208 
00:01:7,780 --> 00:01:8,060 
had 

209 
00:01:8,060 --> 00:01:8,240 
no 

210 
00:01:8,240 --> 00:01:8,500 
money 

211 
00:01:8,500 --> 00:01:8,920 
left, 

212 
00:01:9,120 --> 00:01:9,180 
which 

213 
00:01:9,180 --> 00:01:9,380 
I 

214 
00:01:9,380 --> 00:01:9,700 
believe. 

215 
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:10,720 
He 

216 
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:10,980 
also 

217 
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:11,440 
apparently 

218 
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:11,920 
didn't 

219 
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:12,240 
believe 

220 
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:12,440 
in 

221 
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,000 
cremation, 

222 
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:13,900 
part 

223 
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:14,060 
of 

224 
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:14,220 
why 

225 
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:14,380 
the 

226 
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:14,700 
funeral 

227 
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:14,980 
had 

228 
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:15,120 
to 

229 
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:15,260 
be 

230 
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:15,540 
so 

231 
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:15,920 
much. 

232 
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:17,300 
Catholics 

233 
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:17,700 
for 

234 
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:17,840 
a 

235 
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:18,040 
long 

236 
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:18,400 
time 

237 
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:18,780 
didn't 

238 
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:19,040 
believe 

239 
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:19,240 
in 

240 
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:19,760 
cremation. 

241 
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:20,240 
Now 

242 
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:20,460 
I 

243 
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:20,660 
have 

244 
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:20,940 
money, 

245 
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:21,220 
but 

246 
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:21,440 
paying 

247 
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:21,660 
for 

248 
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:21,820 
this 

249 
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:22,100 
isn't 

250 
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:22,300 
high 

251 
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:22,440 
on 

252 
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:22,580 
my 

253 
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:22,920 
list. 

254 
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:23,340 
I 

255 
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:23,540 
have 

256 
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:23,760 
young 

257 
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:24,140 
kids 

258 
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:24,880 
and 

259 
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:24,980 
I 

260 
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:25,140 
feel 

261 
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:25,280 
the 

262 
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:25,520 
wife 

263 
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:25,780 
should 

264 
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:25,900 
have 

265 
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:26,400 
cremated 

266 
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:26,660 
him 

267 
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:27,140 
if 

268 
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:27,360 
money 

269 
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:27,580 
was 

270 
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:27,700 
an 

271 
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:28,000 
issue. 

272 
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:29,420 
Plus, 

273 
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:29,940 
in 

274 
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:30,140 
what 

275 
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:30,520 
sick 

276 
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:30,720 
and 

277 
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:31,000 
twisted 

278 
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:31,480 
world 

279 
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:31,840 
do 

280 
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:32,000 
I 

281 
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:32,140 
have 

282 
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:32,280 
to 

283 
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:32,460 
pay 

284 
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:32,620

285 
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:32,900 
lady 

286 
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:33,220 
he 

287 
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:33,400 
had 

288 
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:33,520 
an 

289 
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:33,740 
affair 

290 
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:34,180

00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:35,480 
that. 

297 
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:36,200 
He 

298 
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:36,480
