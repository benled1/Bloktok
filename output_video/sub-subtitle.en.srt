1 
00:00:0,000 --> 00:00:4,720 
 Am I the asshole, not paying for father's funeral? 

2 
00:00:4,720 --> 00:00:9,260 
 So my father left our family when my sister and I were in second and sixth grade. 

3 
00:00:9,260 --> 00:00:13,760 
 He had an affair with his secretary at his business and left our family. 

4 
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:18,400 
 At times we would not see him for over a year, or on Christmas he would just show up expecting 

5 
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:21,960 
 to be served dinner after months of no contact. 

6 
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:26,640 
 My mother being super passive would always accommodate him to keep the peace. 

7 
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,720 
 He was even her attorney when they got divorced, not sure how that was allowed. 

8 
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:36,020 
 As a child waiting by the curb for him to pick me up for visitation and no showing is 

9 
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:37,680 
 a vivid memory. 

10 
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:42,520 
 He refused to attend my sister's wedding because her husband to be wasn't Catholic. 

11 
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:47,800 
 Needless to say he never planned things out and was very irresponsible. 

12 
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:50,480 
 These are just a few of the lowlights. 

13 
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,440 
 Fast forward to two weeks ago. 

14 
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,760 
 He apparently fell ill and passed away. 

15 
00:00:54,760 --> 00:01:0,600 
 His second wife mentioned the funeral expenses along with how my father and her were separated. 

16 
00:01:0,600 --> 00:01:4,680 
 She mentioned she had to use up two weeks of vacation while he was sick and pay like 

17 
00:01:4,680 --> 00:01:7,320 
 twenty color for his funeral. 

18 
00:01:7,320 --> 00:01:10,660 
 He apparently had no money left which I believe. 

19 
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:17,440 
 He also apparently didn't believe in cremation, part of why the funeral had to be so much. 

20 
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:20,160 
 Catholics for a long time didn't believe in cremation. 

21 
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:23,240 
 Now I have money but paying for this isn't high on my list. 

22 
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:29,040 
 I have young kids and I feel the wife should have cremated him if money was an issue. 

23 
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:34,280 
 Plus, in what sick and twisted world do I have to pay the lady he had an affair with 

24 
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,200 
 or I can't get beyond that. 

25 
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:40,640 
 He didn't want to be cremated but he wanted son to pay for his funeral. 

26 
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,480 
 Am I the asshole for not cutting her a check and paying for her vacation time?
